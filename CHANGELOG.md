## [Unreleased — Within-AMP Selectivity Benchmark] — 2026-07-01

### v0.5.9 — Within-AMP Selectivity Benchmark

- **Hemolysis reference dataset**: 42 known AMPs with literature HC50 values
  (`examples/validation/hemolysis_reference.csv`): 14 HEMOLYTIC (HC50 < 25 µg/mL),
  21 SELECTIVE (HC50 >= 100 µg/mL), 7 BORDER (25-100 µg/mL)
- **`run_selectivity_benchmark()`** in `benchmark/retrospective.py`: tests whether
  pipeline scorers can distinguish hemolytic from selective AMPs — the within-AMP
  ranking task that the expert ablation identified as the correct test for
  safety/selectivity/synthesis components
- **`bench selectivity` CLI command** + `make bench-selectivity` Makefile target
- **18 new tests** in `test_selectivity_benchmark.py`; 1453 total tests

**Key findings:**

1. Safety scorer FAILS hemolysis detection (detection AUROC=0.3844, CI lo=0.26).
   All 14 hemolytic AMPs score safety >= 0.8. Melittin blind spot confirmed
   quantitatively.
2. Selectivity proxy FAILS hemolysis detection (detection AUROC=0.4133, CI lo=0.28).
   Charge/GRAVY heuristic insufficient.
3. Synthesis feasibility is the only significant hemolysis risk detector
   (detection AUROC=0.8027, CI lo=0.63) — incidental correlation via cysteine
   content and repeat runs in hemolytic AMPs.
4. Expert composite is better than ensemble on hemolysis detection (0.5119 vs
   0.3486) but not significant (CI includes 0.5) at n=14 vs n=21.
5. Activity scorer is anti-selective (detection AUROC=0.34): ranks hemolytic
   AMPs higher due to stronger amphipathic helices. Ensemble inherits this bias.

## [Unreleased — Pre-synthesis Quality Sprint] — 2026-06

**Status:** Pipeline frozen for synthesis batch ordering. All changes below were quality
improvements made before committing the ~$10k wet-lab synthesis budget.

### Latest fixes (PRs #61–72)

- **PR #72** — Face segregation bonus in `activity_likeness_score()`: adds
  `helix_wheel_amphipathic_score × 0.05` as an eighth scoring term capturing how well
  hydrophobic and cationic residues are segregated onto opposite helical faces (complementary
  to μH which measures total moment magnitude); pre-clamp ceiling becomes 1.02 (clamped to
  1.0 by final `clamp01()`); benchmark improvements: pipeline AUROC 0.8348→**0.8420**
  (+0.0072), phase3 AUROC 0.8126→**0.8266** (+0.0140), pipeline AUPRC 0.8443→0.8627,
  phase3 AUPRC 0.8357→0.8479; retrospective test sentinels updated (phase3 ≥0.81, <0.84;
  pipeline remains the config-identity reference); `max_disagreement` raised from 0.40→0.45
  in both pipeline.yaml and phase3.yaml because face_segregation_bonus raises SEED-008
  Trp-rich activity scores by ~0.03, pushing their disagreement from ~0.40 to ~0.43 (no
  non-Trp-rich candidate exceeds 0.41, so the new threshold still blocks genuinely uncertain
  candidates); 6 new tests for face_segregation_bonus (zero when key absent, linear scaling,
  max bonus 0.05, anionic guard priority, Magainin-2 improvement); test for score ceiling
  split into 0.97 (no hw key) and 1.0-clamped (with hw=1.0); 1245 tests passing

- **PR #71** — Rotation-invariant helix-wheel face analysis (`helix_wheel_faces()` in
  `features/physchem.py`): uses the hydrophobic moment vector direction to define the
  hydrophobic face for each specific peptide (rotation-invariant, unlike fixed cos(θ≥0)
  splits); computes face contrast, cationic segregation (h_face_cationic_fraction vs
  ph_face_cationic_fraction), and amphipathic_score (normalised [0,1]); all 6 keys added
  to `compute_features()` output as `helix_wheel_*`; pilot panel analysis: SEED-003/005
  show ideal architecture (contrast 2.06/1.94, 0% cationic on H-face), SEED-006/007 good
  (contrast ~0.96-0.98), SEED-008/009 correctly flagged as non-helical (puroindoline
  aromatic anchoring, Bac2A intracellular targeting — expected by design); 13 new tests;
  `make coverage` + `make typecheck` targets added to Makefile; WET_LAB_HANDOFF.md new
  section with per-seed helix-wheel table and mechanism-specific assay interpretation
  matrix; 1237 tests passing
- **PR #70** — Windowed hydrophobic moment (window=11, Eisenberg standard) + anionic charge guard:
  `max_windowed_hydrophobic_moment()` added to `features/physchem.py`; `max_hydrophobic_moment`
  feature now in `compute_features()` output; `activity_likeness_score()` uses
  `max(hydrophobic_moment, max_hydrophobic_moment)` so long-sequence AMPs (magainin-2: 1.51×
  improvement, cecropin-A: 2.90×) get credit for their best helical window rather than a
  diluted full-sequence average; anionic guard returns 0.0 for peptides with
  `charge_density_ph74 < 0.0` (bacterial membrane repulsion; corrects EEIEIEIEIEIEIEE
  receiving 0.42 erroneously); fixed Python eager-evaluation bug in feature dict fallback
  (`dict.get(key, features["k"])` → `if key in features` conditional); 23 new tests covering
  windowed mu_h behaviour, max_hydrophobic_moment in compute_features(), anionic guard cases;
  AUROC pipeline.yaml 0.8047→0.8348, phase3.yaml 0.7846→0.8126; regression sentinel updated
  (≥0.79); config-identity sentinel updated (<0.82, sits between phase3=0.8126 and
  pipeline=0.8348); METHODS.md and DISCOVERY_PREDICTION.md AUROC values updated;
  1223 tests passing
- **PR #69** — synthesis_readiness_report.md updated for current 20-candidate pilot panel
  (AUROC 0.8047; 43 AMPs; 6 seed families; all output files regenerated: presynth_qc_report.md,
  diversity_report.md, gold_standard_calibration.md); external predictor gate marked PENDING for
  new panel; SEED-007 HIGH SPPS difficulty noted; SEED-008 photolability warning added;
  serum stability caveats from PR #68 incorporated; synthesis decision tree and 6-candidate
  minimal diverse panel recommendation updated; stale reference to old 16-candidate
  confident_panel.csv removed
- **PR #68** — Stage 3 serum stability table updated with actual pilot-panel seed families
  (SEED-003/005/006/007/008/009; old SEED-001/002/004 removed as excluded at earlier gates);
  probability 28–42% → 30–46% (short/Trp-rich model correction; actual pilot-panel data);
  SEED-006/SEED-007 gate labels corrected from Pass to Borderline (scores 0.61–0.67 below
  ≥0.70 threshold); SEED-007 slot count corrected 4→5; Root Cause Analysis updated to
  acknowledge model uncertainty before citing <40 min estimate; early serum screening protocol
  added with time points, concentration, reference control; WET_LAB_HANDOFF.md new section
  with SEED-003/005/008 stability model limitation table
- **PR #67** — JSONL error handling in `pilot-panel` CLI (CRITICAL: bare crash on malformed
  line → structured error with line number and preview); synthesis-order CSV header validation;
  `validate-scoring` stdout now includes `n_positives`, `n_negatives`, `benchmark_type`, `auprc`;
  `check_sequence()` validates canonical amino acids (all 20 standard AAs) before QC;
  WAVE2_PLAN.md SEED-008 Trp mechanism divergence note; CHANGELOG updated for PRs #61–66
- **PR #66** — Removed duplicate validation entry REF-GIG-001 (magainin-2 = REF-MAG-001 counted
  twice); corrected AUROC 0.8086→0.8047 (pipeline), 0.7890→0.7846 (phase3); config-identity
  sentinel tightened from `< 0.83` to `< 0.795`; orphaned DECOY-GIG-001 removed from
  scrambled_decoys.csv; default `recall_ks` updated to [10, 20, 43]; 1191 tests passing
- **PR #65** — Trp-weighted aromatic bonus (1.5× Trp vs Phe/Tyr, PR #65); safety `abs()` bug fix
  (negative charge_density does not cause hemolysis); Eisenberg scale comment corrected; synthesis
  pool regenerated (SEED-006: 11→10, SEED-009: 18→19); AUROC 0.8164→0.8086
- **PR #64** — Stale docs corrected: max_disagreement 0.30→0.40 for phase3.yaml in WET_LAB_HANDOFF;
  reference set "45-sequence" → "72-sequence"; SEED-005 exemplar corrected (KRFFKKIGSALKFA →
  seed KRLFKKIGSALKFL with note about VAR_009)
- **PR #63** — Phase3.yaml AUROC regression test added: gate (>0.70), sentinel (≥0.75), config-
  identity check (<0.83 then <0.795 in PR #66); `make validate-scoring-phase3` Makefile target
- **PR #62** — Discovery probability updated to 10–18% (6 confirmed scaffold families; honest
  corrected estimate replacing prior over-confident numbers)
- **PR #61** — CRITICAL FIX: SEED-008 (puroindoline-a, Trp-rich) reinstated in synthesis pool
  after Boman-scale artifact diagnosis; all 10 seeds generated; max_disagreement raised to 0.40
  for both configs to accommodate mechanism-divergent Trp-rich scaffolds; SEED-004 correctly
  excluded by safety gate; 6 mechanism-diverse scaffold families confirmed

### Added (earlier sprint)

- `docs/WET_LAB_HANDOFF.md` — score interpretation table, synthesis decision thresholds,
  per-flag QC remediation guide, MIC/hemolysis assay protocols, troubleshooting section
- `configs/phase3.yaml` now validated by CI at the same level as `pipeline.yaml`
  (selection keys, weights, filters all pinned in test_config.py)
- `test_compute_features_supplies_synthesis_feasibility_keys` — integration contract test
  ensuring `compute_features()` always returns the three keys accessed without `.get()` by
  `synthesis_feasibility_score()` (`length`, `longest_repeat_run`, `cysteine_fraction`)
- `SynthQC.to_dict()` fully covered with 16 tests (key presence, types, value round-trips)
- `presynth-qc` CLI command now has 4 integration tests (exit code, file creation, flag
  detection, summary table content)
- `validate_json_schema()` error paths covered: ValidationError, missing required field,
  wrong type, FileNotFoundError on bad schema path
- `synthesis_feasibility_score()` missing-key tests document the direct dict-access contract
- `check_panel()` missing-column error tests for `candidate_id` and `sequence`
- `make ci` target: runs `lint` then `test` in one command

### Fixed (earlier sprint)

- `ensemble_score()` no longer crashes with KeyError for missing weight keys; emits
  `UserWarning` listing missing names and defaults to 0.0 (PR #24)
- Eligibility filter: `>= min_novelty` boundary confirmed and tested (PR #24)
- `load_candidates_csv()` validates CSV header before iterating rows; raises descriptive
  `ValueError` instead of bare `KeyError` (PR #25)
- Disagreement gate (`max_disagreement`) added to eligibility filter in `pipeline.py`
  (PR #25); `pipeline.yaml: 0.40`, `phase3.yaml: 0.40` (unified in PR #61)
- `WET_LAB_HANDOFF.md` μH boundary table corrected to `> 0.55` (matching code) vs
  closed interval; phase3 disagreement threshold correctly set to 0.40 in PR #61

### Tests

- **1191 tests passing** (up from initial ~400 at start of sprint; ~814 after earlier sprint)
- All ruff lint checks passing
