# Roadmap

## v0.1 — Safe starter ✓

- toy data;
- transparent heuristic scoring;
- JSON evidence certificates;
- report generation;
- tests and CI.

## v0.2 — Dataset layer ✓

- license-aware dataset loaders;
- dataset cards;
- deduplication;
- cluster splitting (`benchmark/splits.py`);
- leakage checks (`bench leakage` CLI + `test_cluster_split.py`).

## v0.3 — Predictor adapters ✓

- Boman index adapter (independent second scorer, `scoring/boman.py`);
- ensemble scoring with configurable weights (`scoring/ensemble.py`);
- model disagreement uncertainty signal (disagreement = |activity − boman|).

## v0.4 — Benchmark suite ✓

- hidden-positive recovery (`bench baseline`, `test_hidden_active_recovery.py`);
- negative control rejection (`test_negative_penalization.py`, `test_negative_robustness.py`);
- novelty stress test (`test_novelty_pressure.py`);
- toxicity penalty benchmark (`test_toxicity_penalty.py`);
- retrospective AUROC benchmark (`validate-scoring` CLI, AUROC = 0.8164 on demo set).

## v0.5 — Lab-batch package ✓

- pre-registration template (`docs/SELECTION_RULE.md`);
- batch manifest (`outputs/run_manifest.json` with SHA-256 input hashes);
- candidate certificates (JSON + `schemas/candidate.schema.json`);
- expert-review checklist (`docs/EXPERT_REVIEW_PACK.md`);
- wet-lab handoff guide (`docs/WET_LAB_HANDOFF.md`);
- safe publication template (`docs/NOMINATION_REPORT.md`).

## v0.5.x — Scoring enhancements (shipped alongside v0.5)

Implemented during the pre-wet-lab improvement loop (PRs #31–#54):

- Serum stability scoring — HNE elastase + trypsin + chymotrypsin site density
- Selectivity proxy — charge/GRAVY-based mammalian cytotoxicity risk detector
- Pilot panel selection — `pilot_priority` formula with serum stability, novelty, selectivity, cytotox_penalty
- Aggregation propensity scoring — consecutive hydrophobic run + β-branched density
- Aggregation-safe mutation generation — prevents creating VILMFW runs ≥ 4
- Proline synthesis penalty — DKP/coupling-difficulty penalty at > 15% proline
- Helix propensity bonus — Chou-Fasman Pα weight increased 0.01 → 0.03 in activity scorer
- Safety score uses pH-7.4 charge consistently with activity scorer
- C-terminal amidation and N-terminal acetylation recommendations in QC
- Wave 2 D-amino guidance in synthesis order
- DISCOVERY_PREDICTION.md — quantified discovery probability model (~29–49%)

## v1.0 — Validated dry-lab-to-wet-lab loop

- independently reviewed assay batch;
- lab results ingested;
- negative results archived where safe;
- active-learning batch 2 (D-amino variants, MDR strain panel);
- public reproducibility report.
